  <div class="column"><p id="text1">The 30MFF webpage was a way to showcase an in-class activity, in which we shot and edited a short movie/video in 30 minutes each. As a group, we thought that one thing all of us had in common was that much like the rest of the World, each of our home countries had been going through a lockdown. So we decided to make a video on the things people do when stuck at home during lockdown/quarantine. I came up with the idea of displaying my 30MFF video on top of a background of the largest headlines of 2020. I wanted it to highlight the crude reality of the World that went beyond the pandemic and didn't even come to a halt when we were all literally bound in our homes.</p> </div>

  <div class="column"><p id="text1">The aim of this project was to produce a comic that would convey the story of water and highlight the ongoing impact of water pollution.We wanted to raise awareness about the ongoing and perennial deterioration of our water resources. Due to its unsustainable use, water bodies have diminished, making water polluted, and freshwater scarce.We also believed it was important to sow the ideas of water conservation in young minds and thus we meant our comic as a childrenâ€™s comic for easier understanding and to be able to reach a wider audience. We made the water droplet a character and gave it a voice and emotions. This would allow us to effectively convey our message to our target audience.</p> </div>

<div class="column"><p id="text1">The project is to portray the harsh and unforgiving nature of trench combat that took place during WW1. The project would portray the average soldier during the war. The concept is to portray the confusion, stress and horror the average soldier is faced with when fighting against an enemy they don't fully know and for a purpose that is unknown to them. The confusion and stress was to be shown through audio where at the start the monologue showed the soldiers not wanting to be there and were more than ready to go back home. The confusion and horror was to be shown by the overwhelming sounds of war and the constant danger of death they brought upon the battlefield.

<p id="text1"> Hello! My name is Ansh Kachalia and you just visited my website. This website is a collection on 4 projects that I completed during the course of my class Communications Lab. The four projects were based on sound, video and comics. The theme for my website is coding and this is visible in the background, the font and the way the text animated before appearing on the screen. I did this as an ode to my first ever attempt at dealing with code through the course of this class. This was my first time ever doing any form of coding or editing. Although, my website may seem simplistic, it is a culmination of my learnings in this course and I hope that you enjoyed visiting my website. </p>
